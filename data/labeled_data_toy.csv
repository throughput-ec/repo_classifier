LiPD files are the data standard for storing and exchanging data amongst paleoclimate scientists. The package will help you convert your existing paleoclimate observations into LiPD files that can be shared and analyzed.\n\nOrganizing and using your observation data can be time  consuming. Our goal is to let you focus on more important tasks than data wrangling.\n\n-----\n\n\n## How to Cite this code\n\n<a href=""https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/25707644""><img src=""https://zenodo.org/badge/25707644.svg"" alt=""DOI""></a>\n\nUse this link to visit the Zenodo website.

The summary is contained in the file `Paleoclimate Data Standards Concatenated Reponses.xlsx`.  \n\nThe file is organized into tabs representing the various [working groups](http://wiki.linked.earth/Category:Working_Group) on the LinkedEarth wiki and is further divided into the section focus (e.g., trace metals in foraminifera). The first column refers to whether the question applied to legacy or new dataset, the second column contains the property being voted on, the next columns contains the number of votes in each category (essential, recommended, and desired) for the various platforms on which voting was allowed (wiki, twitter, survey).\n\nThe data is used to reproduce Figures 3-15 of the PaleoBest manuscript.\n\n### <a name='core'> Completeness of MD98-2181 </a>\n\nThe file `MD982181_CompletenessCheck.xlsx` is used to assess how complete the MD98-2181 record from [Khider et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013PA002534) is in respect to PaleoBest. Each tab corresponds to the application of the subsection of the standard. The first column lists the applicable property, the second column the recommendation from the community and the third column whether the value for the metadata is present (1: provided, 0: not provided).\n\nThis data is used to reproduce Figure 16 of the PaleoBest manuscript.\n\n### <a name='mind'>Mind maps</a>\n\nThe Mind Maps (Figures 5, 7-15) were produced manually using [Coggle](https://coggle.it/?lang=en-US).\n\nFigure 5: [All Working Groups]( https://coggle.it/diagram/WqMd49MJtB8DbqfH/t/community-standards-for-paleoclimate-data-and-metadata\n)  \nFigure 7: [Cross-Archive Working Group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4W9podcxp86PPvf/t/cross-archive-metadata)  \nFigure 8: [Documentary Archives Working Group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4XNNeGhIngfjHzB/t/historical-documents\n)  \nFigure 9: [Ice cores working group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4XbL-GhImoyjLmd/t/ice-cores\n)  \nFigure 10: [Lake Sediments Working Group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4h9m-GhIjjbm3yX/t/lake-sediments\n)  \nFigure 11: [Marine Sediments Working Group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4iIkodcxlDKTK6v/t/marine-sediments\n)  \nFigure 12: [Speleothem Working Group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4gwj-GhIl4VmfYP/t/speleothem\n)  \nFigure 13: [Tree Working Group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4huaYdcxhdzTB9z/t/trees)  \nFigure 14: [Uncertainties Working Group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4gttodcxjfvSst0/t/uncertainties\n)  \nFigure 15: [Chronologies Working Group](https://coggle.it/diagram/W4hzXeGhIi5Fm0q7/t/chronologies\n)  \n\n## <a name='code'>Software</a>  \n\n`makeNewStdMainFig.py`: Reproduces Figure 3 of the PaleoBest Manuscript, example of a survey question for a new dataset.  \n`makeLegacyStdMainFig.py`: Reproduces Figure 4 of the PaleoBest Manuscript, example of a survey question for a legacy dataset.  \n`makeStdsFigures.py`: Reproduces all supplementary figures from the PaleoBest Manuscript.  \n`MD982181_Completeness_RadarPlot.py`: Reproduces Figure 16 of the PaleoBest manuscript.  \n`mosaicplots.py:` Reproduces Figure 6 of the PaleoBest manuscript.  \n`MiscCalc.py`: Calculates useful statistics.\n\n## <a name='requirements'>Requirements</a>\n\nSoftware has been tested under Python v3.6 and requires the following dependencies:\n* pandas  \n* numpy\n* matplotlib\n* textwrap\n* pylab\n* math\n* colormap\n* easydev\n\n## <a name='contact'> Contact </a>\n\nPlease report issues to <khider@usc.edu>\n\n## <a name='license'>License</a>\n\nThe project is licensed under the GNU Public License.

The code is being developed in the open-source and community-supported R platform. \n\nA peer-reviewed paper describing geoChronR was published in March 2021 in Geochronology, [check it out here](https://doi.org/10.5194/gchron-3-149-2021)\n\n\n## Pre-Installation\n\ngeoChronR is a package for R, and so you\'ll need R to run and install it. geoChronR should work with any version newer than 3.6.0. You can download R for your operating system [here](https://www.r-project.org/).\n\nYou\'ll also need an interface to use R. Although many can work, I strongly recommend RStudio. You can download RStudio for your operating system [here](https://rstudio.com/).\n\nOnce you have R and your interface up and running, you\'ll need to install some packages. Most of this will be handled automatically, but to get started install the remotes package: \n\n```\n install.packages(""remotes"")\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall package in R Studio:\n\n```\nremotes::install_github(""nickmckay/geoChronR"")\n```\n\nLoad the package into the environment:\n\n```\nlibrary(geoChronR)\n```\n\n## Getting started with geoChronR\n\nA great way to get started with geoChronR is to work through [some of the tutorials avialable at the top of the geoChronR documentation page](http://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR). These are also provided as ""vignettes"" that come installed with geoChronR, which you can access by running `browseVignettes(""geoChronR"")`. These examples run through how to create an age model ensemble, perform ensemble correlation, regression, spectral and principal components analysis, and visualize the results. They also show off some of the tools we\'ve built for efficiently working with and visualizing LiPD datasets. \n\nOnce you\'re ready to start applying these techniques to your new data, you\'ll need one more LiPD files. [Thousands of LiPD datasets are available at lipdverse.org](http://lipdverse.org) and the [World Data Service for Paleoclimatology](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data). If you\'d like to create your own dataset, the easiest way is using the [lipd.net/playground](http://lipd.net/playground). This can be a bit daunting at first, but check out the tutorial on the playground, and/or this [youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/rHZ1oZXmF84) to get started.\n\n## How to Cite this Code\n\nMcKay, N.
